Originally conceived in the years between 1999 and 2001, it is the progenitor of the Type 2371*, and of every other Acronym jacket that has followed. This is iteration fifteen.<br/><br/>J1A-GT is the culmination of everything we have learned about building apparel since that time. Everything is new. Everything is the same. The very idea of ǍCROŇYMř rendered in physical, wearable form. A carefully balanced array of functional and aesthetic systems presented here in completely remastered form. Asymmetric. Dynamic. ǍCROŇYMř among equals.<br/><br/>Combine with 3A-1 or 3A-3TS for full INTEROPSǽ functionality. Built with next generation Gore-Tex® Pro fabric technology for improved ruggedness, increased breathability**, and greater comfort in more conditions.<br/><br/>[ Fits: STRAIGHT ]<br/><br/>Modifications from Gen 2.0 include: new multi-position convertible storm collar, storm hood with redesigned visor/circumference adjustment, repositioned and resized GravityPocketsǽ, elongated liner access zip, addition of manubrium height center front snap closure, reintroduction of sleeve hitch tabs.<br/><br/>*Together with 3A-1, the Type 2371 jacket was released in 2002 as one of the main components of ACR KIT-1. KIT-1 was the first commercially available Acronym product.",

Removal of such adhesives may cause the laminate to split along the z-axis causing partial delamination and discoloration of the fabric.<br/><br/>_Never attach pins, needles or staples to the fabric.<br/><br/>_Zip up the garment before washing.
