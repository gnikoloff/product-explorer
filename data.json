      "description": "Generation two point two. J1A was the first ever jacket designed by Acronym. Originally conceived in the years between 1999 and 2001, it is the progenitor of the Type 2371*, and of every other Acronym jacket that has followed. This is iteration fifteen.<br/><br/>J1A-GT is the culmination of everything we have learned about building apparel since that time. Everything is new. Everything is the same. The very idea of ǍCROŇYMř rendered in physical, wearable form. A carefully balanced array of functional and aesthetic systems presented here in completely remastered form. Asymmetric. Dynamic. ǍCROŇYMř among equals.<br/><br/>Combine with 3A-1 or 3A-3TS for full INTEROPSǽ functionality. Built with next generation Gore-Tex® Pro fabric technology for improved ruggedness, increased breathability**, and greater comfort in more conditions.",
